# Random finance projects

I recently read a blog post showcasing some of the "surprising" mathematical facts about early retirement.
I thought some of the assumptions were a little silly, so I wrote my own simulator.

### To run

```python
git clone https://github.com/lhallee/Random-Finance-Projects.git
cd Random-Finance-Projects
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt 
cd retirement_sim
py -m streamlit run retirement.py
```
